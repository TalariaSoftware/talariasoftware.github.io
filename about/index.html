<h3 id="ncms">NCMS</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://ncmanager.org">Neighborhood Council Management System</a> (NCMS) supports
volunteer elected officials
in the government
of the City of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The neighborhood council system is
the smallest unit of government
in Los Angeles.
It was created 
in 1999
to promote more citizen participation
in government
and make government
more responsive
to local needs.
Neighborhood councils are is driven
by unpaid, part-time volunteers
elected and appointed
to represent their communities.</p>

<p>As part
of the LA City government,
neighborhood councils are governed
by a confusing array
of interlocking rules and regulations
including
the Los Angeles City Charter,
the Brown Act (California’s open meeting law),
the California Public Records Act,
regulations created by
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE),
the Board of Neighborhood Commissioners (BONC),
and the City Clerk,
their individual bylaws,
and parliamentary procedure
such as
<em>Robert’s Rules of Order</em>.</p>

<p>NCMS incorporates
years of experience
in the neighborhood council system
to help neighborhood leaders
create agendas, minutes, and other documents
in compliance with law and regulation.
It also provides guidance
on parliamentary procedures.
during meetings</p>

<h3 id="cdc-faq-api">CDC FAQ API</h3>

<p>In the spring and summer
of 2020
governments and individuals
around the world
struggled with fear, confusion, and disinformation
regarding the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>In collaboration
with the office
of the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/cto/">CTO of NYC</a> and <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>,
the digital services agency
of the Federal Government,
Talaria Software designed, implemented, and deployed an API
to allow anyone
to incorporate coronavirus information
on their website.
This enables websites
relying on CDC information
to be confident
that they are
providing users
with the most accurate and up-to-date
information available.</p>

<p>The API was incorporated
in the CDC website
and is <a href="https://faq.coronavirus.gov/api/">available there</a>.</p>
