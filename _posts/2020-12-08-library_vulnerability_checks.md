This is part of [The Annotated Guide to a New Rails
App](the_annotated_guide_to_a_new_rails_app), a list of recommendations to make
developing your Rails app more productive and joyful.

In this article, we are talking about checking for library vulnerabilities.

## When

You should check for library vulnerability before creating a production
environment.

## Why

As soon as you make your application available on the Internet, if there is a
vulnerability in one of the libraries you used, it is possible that that
vulnerability could be used to compromise your application.

## How

Use [bundler-audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit#readme) to check for
known security vulnerabilities in your gems.

To install, add `gem 'bundler-audit'` to the development section of your
`Gemfile` and run `bundle`.

To run the checks, use the command `bundle audit`.

Update any gems with vulnerabilities.

<!-- link to gem update and default rake task -->

## Alternatives

There are services that will monitor your running applications for libraries with
known vulnerabilities. They are a much better solution for applications that are
not under active development or that, for some other reason, go a long time
between updates.
