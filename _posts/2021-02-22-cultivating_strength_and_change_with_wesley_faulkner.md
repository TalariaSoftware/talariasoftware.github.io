I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the caring Wesley Faulkner to the
Greater than Code podcast [episode
221](https://www.greaterthancode.com/cultivating-strength-and-change).

Wesley's superpower is connecting with people on a personal level. It's a skill
he developed from not having a particular group he felt he fit in with.

We discussed how people are different with different strengths and weaknesses
and what that means for working together in teams and companies.
