I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the insightful and visionary
Eva PenzeyMoog to the Greater than Code podcast [episode
252](https://www.greaterthancode.com/designing-for-safety).

Eva's superpower is her ADHD-mediated hyper-focus.

We discussed her book, *Design for Safety* and challenges for tech creators when
technology so easily becomes a tool for interpersonal abuse. We also talked
how to move forward given that if the things you are building can be used for
harm, they will be used for harm.

Warning: there is some discussion of domestic violence, abuse, and interpersonal
saftey in this episode.
