I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the lovely Mando Escamilla to the
Greater than Code podcast [episode 219](https://www.greaterthancode.com/how-are-you-doing).

Mando's superpower is the ability to talk about anything personal with other
people. He got it during a difficult time in his life when he suddenly could no
longer bottle up his feelings.

We discussed how we are all managing the difficult and traumatic time we are
going through as a society, how we feel about it, and what to do about it.
