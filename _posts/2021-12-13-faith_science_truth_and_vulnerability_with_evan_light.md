Mae Beale, Casey Watts, and I welcomed the lovely Evan Light to the Greater
than Code podcast [episode 262](https://www.greaterthancode.com/faith-science-truth-and-vulnerability).

His superpower is talking about topics that might not be interesting.

We talked about vulnerability, neurodiversity, spirituality, and philosophy.
Talking with Evan, it was amazing how these lofty theoretical ideas are so
closely related to real human experience.
