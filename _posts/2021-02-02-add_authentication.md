In this article, we are talking about adding authentication.

## When

Authentication is the process of identifying who your user is. You should add it
as soon as your app needs to know who its users are.

## How

Use [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise#getting-started).

## Gotchas

Authentication is separate from authorization. We'll talk about authorization in
a separate article.
