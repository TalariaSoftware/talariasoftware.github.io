In this article, we are talking about setting up your Git repository.

## When

Before you make any substantive changes to your codebase, you are going to want
to store it in a version control system.

## Why

Version control systems maintain a record of your changes.

This allows you to make changes with confidence because you can always see
exactly what has changed and can efficiently undo it if necessary.

It makes it easy to collaborate and share code with with other people,
efficiently sharing changes and ensuring they have the correct version.

Finally, version control systems make it easy to store code on remote systems,
for collaboration, deployment, or just as a backup.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is overwhelmingly the most popular version control
system for computer code.

## How

If you created your project by running `rails new` (as outlined
[here](rails_new)), you will already have a git repository. If not, you
can initialize your repository with `git init <project_dir>`.

`<project_dir>` is usually the current directory, so the command becomes `git
init .`

You can [create a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new) to share your
code or have an off-site backup.
