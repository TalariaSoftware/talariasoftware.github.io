I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the fearless Elyse Robinson to
the Greater than Code podcast [episode
222](https://www.greaterthancode.com/evaluating-human-performance).

Elyse's superpower is her fearlessness which she developed from being driven
into scary situations.

We discussed what tech companies do that keep people out of the tech industry,
despite the massive talent shortage.
