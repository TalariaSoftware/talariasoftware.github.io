Chant√© Thurmond, Arty Starr, and I welcomed the open and impressive Nikema Prophet to the Greater
than Code podcast episode 269.

Her superpower is an ability to connect to people through vulnerability.

We discussed emotional vulnerability, authenticity, neuro-divergence in tech,
and being radically soft.
