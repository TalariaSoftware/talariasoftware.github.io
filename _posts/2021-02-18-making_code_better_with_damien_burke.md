I was honored to be a guest on NewRelic's [Polyglot
podcast](https://dev.to/polyglot/making-code-better-with-damien-burke) with host
[Ali Finkelstein](https://twitter.com/endingwithali).

I talked about user experience, in a broad sense that also includes developers,
and about god objects, what they are, where they come from, and what to do about
them.

Then I told everyone listening to write ugly code.

Listen for yourself on [Polyglot's

wherever you get your podcasts.
