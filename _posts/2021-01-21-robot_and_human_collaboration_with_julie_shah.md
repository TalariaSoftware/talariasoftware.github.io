I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the insightful Julie Shah to the
Greater than Code podcast [episode 216](https://www.greaterthancode.com/robot-and-human-collaboration).

Prof. Shah directs the Interactive Robotics Group in the Schwarzman College of
Computing at MIT and is an associate dean of social implications and
responsibilities of computing.

We discussed some of the subjects in her new book ["What To Expect When You're
Expecting
Robots"](https://www.amazon.com/What-Expect-Youre-Expecting-Robots/dp/1541699114)
including how and when to structure the world for machines and the interactions
between humans and machines in public spaces.
