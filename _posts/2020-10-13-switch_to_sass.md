In this article, we are talking about switching to Sass.

## When

I recommend making the switch before investing any significant effort into your
CSS (cascading stylesheets).

## What

Sass is a superset of CSS that makes writing stylesheets easier and more
pleasant.

## How

Sass is installed by default so all you need to do is change the file extension.

`git mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.{css,scss}`
