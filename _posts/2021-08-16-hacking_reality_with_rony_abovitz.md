I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the charming
Rony Abovitz to the Greater than Code podcast episode 245.

Rony's superpower is his free-wheeling imagination, insight, and intuition.

We discussed the dichotomy between environments that are open, free, and
unstructured contrasted with the rigid hierarchies and bureaucracies that we all
despise. We also made connections between that and the nature of human
enlightenment and transcendence.
