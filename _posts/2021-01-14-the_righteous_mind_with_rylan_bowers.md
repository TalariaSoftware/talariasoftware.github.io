I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the lovely Ryan Bowers to the
Greater than Code podcast [episode 214](https://www.greaterthancode.com/the-righteous-mind).

We discussed ["The Righteous Mind"](https://righteousmind.com) by Jonathan Haidt
and dug into the nature and origin of morality and moral decision making. This
was my first introduction to the individual-on-an-elephant metaphor which I am
sure I will be using extensively.
