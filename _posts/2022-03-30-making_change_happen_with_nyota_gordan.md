Casey Watts, John Sawers, and I welcomed the insightful and enlightening Nyota
Gordan to the Greater than Code podcast [episode
275](https://www.greaterthancode.com/making-change-happen-why-not-you).

Nyota's superpower is an ability hear what people are saying and make it more
clear, actionable, and profitable.

We talked about a lot of things, but what had the biggest impact on me was the
discussion on the intersection of cybersecurity and employee wellness. Nyota
summed it up at one point by saying "resilience is being able to take a breath."
