Mandy Moore, Jessica Kerr, and I welcomed the generous and kind Paul Rayner to
the Greater than Code podcast [episode
271](https://www.greaterthancode.com/eventstorming).

Paul's superpower is an ability try new scary things.

We discussed tools and techniques for collaborating with people who have
different perspectives.
