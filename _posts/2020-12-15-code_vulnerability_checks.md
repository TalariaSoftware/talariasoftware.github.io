This is part of [The Annotated Guide to a New Rails App](the_annotated_guide_to_a_new_rails_app), a list of
recommendations to make developing your Rails app more productive and joyful.

In this article, we are talking about checking for code vulnerabilities.

## When

You should check for code vulnerabilities before creating a production environment.

## Why

As soon as you make your application available on the Internet, if there is a
vulnerability in your code, it is possible that that vulnerability could be used
to compromise your application.

## How

Use [Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org) for code analysis to catch potential
security vulnerabilities.

To install, add `gem 'brakeman'` to the development section of your `Gemfile` and
run `bundle`.

To run use the command `brakeman`.

Fix any issues Brakeman finds.

<!-- link to default rake task -->

## Gotchas

Brakeman checks for a lot of common errors that create security vulnerabilities.
Of course, it cannot catch all security issues. Be careful out there.
