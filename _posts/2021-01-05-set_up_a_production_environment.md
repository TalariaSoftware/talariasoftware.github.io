This is part of [The Annotated Guide to a New Rails
App](the_annotated_guide_to_a_new_rails_app), a list of recommendations to make
developing your Rails app more productive and joyful.

In this article, we are talking about setting up a production environment.

## When

In the interest of rapid user feedback and iteration, I recommend doing this as
soon as possible.

## Why

A production environment makes your app available to people who aren't using
your development machine.

## How

[Create a Heroku app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app)

## Alternatives

Almost every web hosting company can deploy Rails apps. Some can be cheaper than
Heroku in certain scenarios. None that I know of are easier to start with.

Heroku is incredibly easy to use and can be used for free to start. I recommend
starting with it.
