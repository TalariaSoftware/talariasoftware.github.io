I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the amazing Chelsea Troy to the
Greater than Code podcast [episode 207](https://www.greaterthancode.com/investigation-and-influence).

We talked about software detective work and then went deep into practical
considerations for living our values and making an impact as technologists and
engineers. There are even a few tidbits on fallibility and Lucifer (the TV
series).
