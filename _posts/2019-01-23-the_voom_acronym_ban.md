VAB is the “Voom Acronym Ban” and it is exactly what it sounds like — a ban on
the use of acronyms. Here at Voom, we don’t call it the VAB for obvious
reasons. But we also don’t call it the Voom Acronym Ban.

To start, it’s not specific to Voom, it’s something that anyone can and should
do.

Second, it isn’t limited to acronyms; it also applies to initialisms. In fact,
it includes abbreviations, jargon and any other language that can obscure
meaning.

Finally, it isn’t a ban. We use acronyms when necessary and the meaning is
clear, but avoid them as much as possible.

Why? Because acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, and jargon obscure meaning.

In the best case scenario people will ask for clarification when needed. By
avoiding the need to do so we ensure we are inclusive to team members who are
newer, less experienced, or mitigating representation bias as an
underrepresented minority.

It is worse when people do not know that clarification is needed. If someone
recommends you take a trip on LSD while in Chicago you might not know to ask if
they are using the common initialism for the scenic Chicago road named Lake
Shore Drive.

Obscuring the meaning of a name makes it less obvious when you are changing its
nature or purpose. It’s clear that first-strike capability is not appropriate
for a Department of Defense. It’s less clear that that is true for the DoD.

We don’t have the VAB at Voom. What we have is a preference for clear language
that avoids acronyms, initialisms, abbreviations, and jargon whenever possible.

Like most matters of team culture, this is demonstrated most effectively
through example. Our codebase, documentation, and user stories have few to no
acronyms, initialisms, or jargon. It is also rare to hear them in a meeting or
pairing session.

They still show up occasionally. When they do someone on the team will ask for
clarification and gently remind us of our preference for clear language. It can
sound like this, “What does X mean?” or “Can we call it something that makes it
clear what it is?”

These reminders are most effective when they come from senior members of the
team. It demonstrates that the preference is not the result of a lack of
expertise or knowledge and it sets a standard for the entire team.

Using clear, concise, and accurate language is difficult. It’s even more
difficult when the nature of the things are constantly changing like they do at
Voom or within any ongoing startup or software project. The benefit is
improvement in clarity and shared understanding.
