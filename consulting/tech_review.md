# Expert Tech Review

Starting at $3,000

The Expert Tech Review provides targeted technical expertise for your business
needs.

Would you be able to make better decisions by consulting with a technical
expert? Are you contemplating making an important investment in a software
product or business?

The Expert Tech Review
brings in
a highly experienced and highly skilled engineer
to answer your questions
and, perhaps more importantly,
help you figure out
what questions to ask
before making a decision
that is important
to your business.

## How It Works

We start by meeting
with you
to learn about your business
and what you are trying to accomplish.
Then we collaborate
to identify and prioritize
what you need to know.

After that, we get to work.
Working from
our list of priorities,
we apply decades
of experience
to research, discover, and collate
the information you need.

Within three business days,
we'll deliver a report
detailing what we've found
in a clear an actionable manner.
We'll finish with a meeting
for you to ask questions
and ensure you have clarity.

## Is This for You?

This program is not a good fit for everyone.
In many cases,
it is not worthwhile
to invest this much
into making
the best decision you can.
But if this is something
that interests you,
