# Partnerships

Percentage of revenue or profit

Our partnership program provides long-term support technical support for your
web application.

This is for business owners who
have a working Rails app with paying customers. We provide the technical
expertise to make sure your software stays up-to-date and continues to serve
your customers for a long time to come.

## How It Works

In exchange for a portion of your revenue or profit, you get an engineering
partner who can ensure your app is fast, reliable, secure, and available 24/7.

Your customers keep using the app they love, and you never have to worry about
security, maintenance, updates, or any other technical issues.

We negotiate partnerships on a case by case basis, because every app
is different and has different needs and requirements. Apps that come out of our
Build Your App or Rails Rescue programs are best suited for this because we know
they are secure and maintainable.

## Is This for You?

This program isn't for everyone. It requires a high degree of mutual trust
and an application that is generating revenue
with good prospects for the future.

Because this is a full partnership, I cannot offer it to everyone. If this is
