# Partnerships

Percentage of revenue or profit

Our partnership program is designed to make it possible for experts in their
field to own and operate a web app that serves their customers and generates
passive income, without ever needing worry about security, maintenance, updates,
or any other technical issues.

This is for entrepreneurs and business owners who have a working Rails
application and paying customers, but need technical expertise to make sure it
stays up-to-date and continues to serve their customers for a long time to come.

## How it works

In exchange for a portion of your revenue or profit, you get an engineering
partner who can ensure your app is fast, reliable, secure, and available 24/7.

Our partnership deals are negotiated on a case by case basis, because every app
is different and has different needs and requirements. Apps that come out of our
Build Your App or Rails Rescue programs are best suited for this because we know
they are secure and maintainable.

## Is This for You?

This program isn't for everyone. It requires a high degree of mutual trust
and you will need to already have an application that is generating revenue
with good prospects for the future. If that sounds like you, click here to book
an interview.

Because this is a full partnership, I cannot offer it to everyone. But if this
is something that you are interested in, click here to book a interview with me.
