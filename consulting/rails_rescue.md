# Rails Rescue

$1,500 per day, per engineer

With the Rails Rescue program
you get
highly experienced and highly skilled engineers
who are focused
on making
your Rails application
more reliable,
more maintainable,
and more secure.

This is for entrepreneurs and teams
who have a Rails app
that is
giving them trouble.
Is it your app
difficult to maintain,
slow,
or crashing?
Did you fail a security audit
and don't have
the capacity
to fix the problems?
Do you need
to migrate
to a different hosting platform,
upgrade gems,
or upgrade Rails itself?
Or do you need
preventative maintenance
to take care
of these issues
before they are
a problem?

## How It Works

We start by meeting
your team,
learning about your app
and the problems
you are having.
Then we collaborate
on a prioritized list
of things
to fix.

Then we get to work.
Working from
our list of priorities,
we apply decades
of experience
to mitigate your problems
one by one.

In most cases,
you will get tangible improvements
in your codebase,
on an approximately daily basis,
for as long
as we are working together.

## Is This for You?

Because this is
a highly collaborative process,
itâ€™s not available to everyone.
You will be working closely
with me and my team
and we are picky
about who
we work with.

this is something
that you are
