# Rails Rescue

$1,500 per day, per engineer

The Rails Rescue program provides targeted technical expertise for your Rails
application.

Is your app difficult to maintain, slow, or crashing? Did you fail a security
audit? Do you need to migrate to a different hosting platform, upgrade gems, or
upgrade Rails itself? Or do you need preventative maintenance to take care of
these issues before they are a problem?

The Rails Rescue program
brings in
highly experienced and highly skilled engineers
to solve your problems. They will make
your Rails application
more reliable,
more maintainable,
and more secure.

## How It Works

We start by meeting
your team,
learning about your app,
and identifying the problems.
Then we collaborate
to list your priorities.

After that, we get to work.
Working from
our list of priorities,
we apply decades
of experience
to mitigate your problems
one by one.

In most cases,
you will see tangible improvements
each day
that we work together.

## Is This for You?

This program is not available to everyone. It is a highly collaborative
process. You will be working closely with our team and we are very selective
about who we work with. If this interests you, click here to book an interview
