# Consulting

You have a vision:
an online application
that serves specific clients
in a niche
you know well.
Technological advancements have made it
easier than ever
to make that happen.

But you still need
people you trust
with the specific skills
to turn your vision
into reality.

I've been building
web startups
since 1999.
I've been an engineer, founder, VP, CTO, and product manager.
Before the pandemic,
I was the senior product manager
at Voom,
the on-demand helicopter startup
from Airbus.
Now I'm spending
more time
with independent founders.

If you've ever dreamed
of having a successful web app,
I'd like
to help
you make
that dream
a reality.
