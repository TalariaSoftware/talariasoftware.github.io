# Consulting

Technological advancements have made it
easier than ever
to create a software application
and make it available
on the web
all day,
every day,
to everyone in the world.
That means
it's easier than ever
to create something
that fills a niche
and generates
ongoing passive income.
And there are
millions of niches
to fill.

But if you don't
already know how
to make software,
you need someone
you can trust
to bring
your vision
into reality
and support it
along the way.

I've been building
web startups
since 1999.
I've been an engineer, founder, VP, CTO, and product manager.
Before the pandemic,
I was the senior product manager
at Voom,
an on-demand helicopter startup
from Airbus.
Now
I'm spending
more and more time
with independent founders.

If you've ever dreamed
of having a successful web app,
I'd like
to help
you make
that dream
a reality.
