### EarlyWords

[EarlyWords](https://earlywords.io) was created
by [52 Sketches](https://52sketches.com),
a collaboration
between Damien Burke and Rob Head.

Inspired by morning pages,
a practice
in Julia Cameron's _The Artist's Way_,
Rob conceived
of a software tool
that would guide and encourage people
in a practice
that would unchain
the artist within them.

Together,
Rob and Damien
built, designed, implemented, and deployed
a complete web-based consumer product
that makes people
more creative
every day.

### NCMS

The [Neighborhood Council Management System](https://ncmanager.org) (NCMS) supports
volunteer elected officials
in the government

The neighborhood council system is
the smallest unit of government
in Los Angeles.
It was created 
in 1999
to promote more citizen participation
in government
and make government
more responsive
to local needs.
Neighborhood councils are is driven
by unpaid, part-time volunteers
elected and appointed
to represent their communities.

As part
of the LA City government,
neighborhood councils are governed
by a confusing array
of interlocking rules and regulations
including
the Los Angeles City Charter,
the Brown Act (California's open meeting law),
the California Public Records Act,
regulations created by
the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment (DONE),
the Board of Neighborhood Commissioners (BONC),
and the City Clerk,
their individual bylaws
and parliamentary procedure
such as
_Robert's Rules of Order_.

NCMS incorporates
years of experience
in the neighborhood council system
to help neighborhood leaders
create agendas, minutes, and other documents
in compliance with law and regulation
It also provides guidance
on parliamentary procedures.

### CDC FAQ API

In the spring and summer
of 2020
governments and individuals
around the world
struggled with fear, confusion, and disinformation
regarding the coronavirus pandemic.

In collaboration
with the office
of the [CTO of NYC](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/cto/) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov),
the digital services agency
of the Federal Government,
Talaria Software designed, implemented, and deployed an API
to allow anyone
to incorporate coronavirus information
on their website.
This enables websites
relying on CDC information
to be confident
that they are
providing users
with the most accurate and up-to-date
information available.

The API was incorporated
in the CDC website
and is [available there](https://faq.coronavirus.gov/api/).
