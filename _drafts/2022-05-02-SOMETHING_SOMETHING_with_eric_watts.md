Nyota Gordan, Casey Watts, and I welcomed the kind and lovely Eric Watts to the
Greater than Code podcast [episode
280](https://www.greaterthancode.com/SOMETHING-SOMETHING).

Eric's superpower is perseverance and stubbornness.

We talked about the importance of physicality in designing both interiors and
software as well as how to design things for people who are very different from
you and have a different experience of the world.
