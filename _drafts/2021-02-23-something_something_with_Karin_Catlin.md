I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the insightful Karen Catlin to
the Greater than Code podcast [episode
224](https://www.greaterthancode.com/something-something).

Karen's superpower is an ability to simplify broad and complex ideas. She uses
it to help people become better allies for marginalized people in the workplace.

We discussed her journey in the tech industry from engineering manager, to
coach, to author and speaker. And she shared some valuable techniques for
recognizing the harmful impacts of biases and how to do something about it.
