Chant√© Thurmond, Arty Starr, and I welcomed the open and impressive Nikema Prophet to the Greater
than Code podcast [episode
269](https://www.greaterthancode.com/something-something).

Their superpower is an ability to connect to people through vulnerability.

We discussed emotional vulnerability, authenticity, neuro-divergence in tech,
and being radically soft.
