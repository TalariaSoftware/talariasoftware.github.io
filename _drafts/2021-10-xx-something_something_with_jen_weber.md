Arty Starr and I welcomed the brilliant and insightful Jen Weber to the Greater
than Code podcast [episode 2XX](https://www.greaterthancode.com/XXX).

Their superpower is an ability to visualize how things go well.

We discussed the perils and pitfalls of managing a huge open-source project like
EmberJS, where Jen is a core contributor. She shared some amazingly useful
frameworks like asking what benefits for contributors to open source? What are
the benefits to the sponsors?
