I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the insightful and visionary
Eva Penzey-Moog to the Greater than Code podcast [episode
2XX](https://www.greaterthancode.com/XXX).

Eva's superpower is her ADHD-mediated hyper-focus.

We discussed her book, *Design for Safety* and challenges for tech creators when
technology so easily becomes a tool for interpersonal abuse. We also talked
how to move forward given that if the things you are building can be used for
harm, they will be.
