Mandy Moore, Jessica XXXX and I welcomed the generous and kind Paul Rayner to
the Greater than Code podcast [episode
271](https://www.greaterthancode.com/something-something).

His superpower is an ability try new scary things.

We discussed tools and techniques for collaborating with people who have
different perspectives.
