I was one of the hosts lucky enough to welcome the careful and 
Bri Gowden to the Greater than Code podcast [episode
244](https://www.greaterthancode.com/something-something).

Bri's superpower is her awareness of and physical connection to people's
feelings.

We discussed the importance of trust and techniques for making technical and
political systems more equitable. We had some amazing realizations about
reinforcement systems, inherent dangers in measurement, and the importance of
confidence intervals, and other non-binary ways of thinking.
