        <p>Nowadays it’s easier than ever to go from an idea to an site on the web that is
available 24/7, 365, all over the world. That means it’s easier than ever to
create something that fills a niche and generates ongoing passive income. And
there are thousands or millions of niches to fill.</p>

<p>But if you don’t already know how to make software, you need someone you can
trust to bring your vision into reality.</p>

<p>I’ve been building Internet startups since 1999 as an engineer, founder, VP of
engineering, CTO, and product manager. Before the pandemic I was the senior product
manager at Voom, an on-demand helicopter startup from Airbus. But now I’m
spending more and more time with independent founders.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever dreamed of making a successful webapp, I’d like to help you make
that dream a reality. If you know who you are eager to serve and what problems
they have, we can figure out how to create something that will make their lives
better and serve their specific needs.</p>

<p>At the end of the process you’ll have a fully-functioning Internet application,
ready to promote to users all over the world.</p>

<p>And to top it off, you’ll have a partner able to do the maintenance and updates
needed and who is invested in your success.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-new-app">The Full New App</h2>

<p>$50k/month for three months</p>

<!-- - Two full-time engineers (6 hours/day, 4 days/week)
- A part-time designer (6 hours/day, 1 day/week?)
  $1200/day, 9days/wk, = $11,800/wk, 47.2k/mo -->

<p>With this package you get a full team to take you from idea to functioning
application.</p>

<p>This is for entrepreneurs who have the resources and are ready to
commit to make their dream a reality. You need to understand your customers,
understand their needs, and be ready and able to invest in creating a solution
for them. Because this is a collaboration, you also need to be available to
answer questions and work with the team as necessary during business hours and
to meet with the team for an hour at least once a week.</p>

<p>We start at the beginning, with an inception. We spend all day together,
learning about your customers and fleshing out your vision until we know enough
to turn it into a series of actionable deliverables.</p>

<p>Then we get to work. Two full-time engineers and one part-time designer work
together to add, piece by piece, the elements to make your dream a reality.
You’ll see improvement to your product on an approximately daily basis, and
receive a report on the progress every week.</p>

<p>Soon, you’ll have a minimum viable product that you can use to start building a
base of paying customers and adapting to their feedback.</p>

<p>This program isn’t for everyone. It requires a large investment of time, effort,
and money. But if you have the resources and believe in your idea, it is the
best way to get a working app in front of customers.</p>

<p>Because this is a highly collaborative process, it’s not available to everyone.
You will be working closely with me and my team and we are picky about who we
work with. But if this is something that you are interested in, click here to
book a interview with me.</p>

<h2 id="rails-rescue">Rails Rescue</h2>

<p>$1,400/per day/per engineer</p>

<!-- [$200/hr * 7hr/day = $1400] -->

<p>With this package you get highly experienced Rails engineers who are skilled and
focused on making your app more reliable and maintainable.</p>

<p>This is for entrepreneurs and teams who have a Rails app that is giving them
trouble. Is it your app difficult to maintain, slow, or crashing? Are there
security vulnerabilities in the app or some of it’s libraries? Do you need to
migrate to a different hosting provider or platform? Or do you need preventative
maintanence to keep any of those things from happening?</p>

<p>Get highly skilled and highly experienced engineers who have seen all these
issues and know how to prioritize and rectify them.</p>

<p>In most cases you will have tangible improvements to your codebase on a daily
basis for as long as we work together.</p>

<p>Because this is a highly collaborative process, it’s not available to everyone.
You will be working closely with me and my team and we are picky about who we
work with. But if this is something that you are interested in, click here to
book a interview with me.</p>

<h2 id="engineering-partner">Engineering partner</h2>

<p>Cost: percent of revenue, profit, or ownership</p>

<p>In exchange for a portion of your revenue or profit, you get an engineering
partner who can ensure your app is fast, reliable, secure, and available 24/7.</p>

<p>These are negotiated on a case by case basis, because every app is different
with different needs and requirements. Clients who purchase the Full New App or
a Rails Rescue package are best position for this because we would have put in
the work to make their app easy to work with.</p>

<p>Because this is a full partnership, I cannot offer it to everyone. But if this
is something that you are interested in, click here to book a interview with me.</p>
