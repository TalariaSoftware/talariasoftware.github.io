Greater than Code <a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/joy-is-activism">episode 277.</a></p>

<p>We discussed how the past two years had changed things for us. That lead
smoothly into a discussion of magic and how to introduce magic into non-magical
environments.</p>

Gordan to the Greater than Code podcast <a href="https://www.greaterthancode.com/making-change-happen-why-not-you">episode

<p>Nyota’s superpower is an ability hear what people are saying and make it more
clear, actionable, and profitable.</p>

<p>We talked about a lot of things, but what had the biggest impact on me was the
discussion on the intersection of cybersecurity and employee wellness. Nyota
summed it up at one point by saying “resilience is being able to take a breath.”</p>

<p>Their superpower is an ability to visualize how things go well.</p>

<p>We discussed the perils and pitfalls of managing a huge open-source project like
EmberJS, where Jen is a core contributor. They shared some amazingly useful
frameworks like asking what benefits for contributors to open source? What are
the benefits to the sponsors?</p>

252</a>.</p>

<p>Eva’s superpower is her ADHD-mediated hyper-focus.</p>

<p>We discussed her book, <em>Design for Safety</em> and challenges for tech creators when
technology so easily becomes a tool for interpersonal abuse. We also talked
how to move forward given that if the things you are building can be used for
harm, they will be used for harm.</p>

<p>Warning: there is some discussion of domestic violence, abuse, and interpersonal
saftey in this episode.</p>

245</a>.</p>

<p>Rony’s superpower is his free-wheeling imagination, insight, and intuition.</p>

<p>We discussed the dichotomy between environments that are open, free, and
unstructured contrasted with the rigid hierarchies and bureaucracies that we all
despise. We also made connections between that and the nature of human
enlightenment and transcendence.</p>

<p>Brianna’s superpower is her awareness of and physical connection to people’s
feelings.</p>

<p>We discussed the importance of trust and techniques for making technical and
political systems more equitable. We had some amazing realizations about
reinforcement systems, inherent dangers in measurement, and the importance of
confidence intervals, and other non-binary ways of thinking.</p>

236</a>.</p>

<p>Marlena’s superpower is bringing the arts to tech.</p>

<p>Marlena discussed the application of sketching, drawing, crafting, zines, other
forms of art to our work as technologists. We made some important connections
between the use of art (or lack thereof) and the colonialist culture that
pervades the tech industry.</p>
